The files in this directory contain extracted features for doing parse
selection on the Redwoods treebank. There are four files, each
corresponding to a different section of the treebank, and each
containing features for sentences with 10 parses or less. The feature
set is the "DT-NGRAM" feature set on derivation trees, discussed in
the following paper:
