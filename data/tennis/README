This example directory contains data (in C4.5 format) from Figure 3.2,
page 59, of Tom Mitchell's book Machine Learning. The data is Fig 3.2
is contained in the file train.data. The file test.data contains the
novel instance on page 178, plus a bunch of other instances I made up
that more or less followed the pattern.

This is basically just a very small example to allow one to test that
the installation of TADM is working.
